Hi! Thank you for downloading the AirportCEO Mod Loader! The final step before usage is installation.


The installation method depends on your operating system:
Windows - Launch the "AirportCEO Mod Loader Installer.exe". If you get a success message, you are good to go! Otherwise follow the manual 	  installation instructions below.

Mac     - You will have to follow the manual installation instructions below.


**Manual Installation Directions**
Go back one folder, and then go Mod Loader Core > [YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM]. Paste the contents of the folder you were at (....../Windows or ....../Mac) into your game exe directory. This can be found most often at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Airport CEO" on windows. However, it may change depending on your operating system and current setup. If you are having trouble finding it, search for "steamapps", it will generally bring you to the right place. If you are still having trouble
