BepInEx 5.4.22

### ⚠️ BepInEx 5 now enters long term support (LTS) mode
BepInEx 5.4 is the last version of BepInEx 5 with major updates. Any BepInEx 5 releases starting version 5.4 will be minor and only contain fixes along with package version updates. Our main development focus now shifts to implementing BepInEx 6.

For developers: BepInEx 5 source code is now maintained on [`v5-lts`](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/tree/v5-lts) branch. In turn `master` branch will start hosting BepInEx 6 source. All PRs regarding BepInEx 5 should be targeting that branch instead of `master`.
